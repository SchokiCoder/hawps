## Holding ALT key to see key binds

Earlier I thought that my UI would be a lot more complex than it is now.  
Arrow keys switch the only two TileSets,
and spawing via keyboard is not yet planned.
Maybe as more tools come along, if there are more tools coming along,
this would change.  
For now, this makes not much sense.
