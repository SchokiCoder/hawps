# 1st rework

## Why a rework (to another one of my repos)

"physics_box" originally started out as a simple "physics" sandbox game but at
some point i started thinking something like "What if i took this whole thing
way too serious?".  
A "half-assed wannabee physics simulation", that makes physicists and chemists
want to strangle me.  
That is my honest evaluation of the project after i left it rot for more than a
year...  
And that's how "hawps" is born.  

## Now

Now, "hawps" is the ironic name of the show instead of the painful truth.  
So strap yourselves in.  
We got a bumpy new roadmap ahead of us.  

## Kicking the dead horse

I don't know why i started t think that it would be a good idea to try a serious
simulation of physics but i am sure it killed all my fun back then.  
This pile of +#!% also suffered from my good old habit of jumping into a new
thing without ever thinking it through.  
Dipshittery is dead, long live <goals.md>.
