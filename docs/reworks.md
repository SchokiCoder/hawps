# 2nd rework

Godot or any other game engine seems to not really be a good fit.
I wanted this initially for the collision physics, but it turned out that this
is far too complex in the first place.
Reject polygons, return to pixels...
and with that to just programming languages.
This should be more fun anyways.
Now, which langauge?

Rust: Meh, too annyoing.
Zig:  No tabs... dumb.
C:    Memory and pointer fun, but janky.
Go:   Maybe too easy.
Odin: Maybe, but didn't compile last time. Plus need to learn.

# 1st rework

## Why a rework (to another one of my repos)

"physics_box" originally started out as a simple "physics" sandbox game but at
some point i started thinking something like "What if i took this whole thing
way too serious?".  
A "half-assed wannabee physics simulation", that makes physicists and chemists
want to strangle me.  
That is my honest evaluation of the project after i left it rot for more than a
year...  
And that's how "hawps" is born.  

## Now

Now, "hawps" is the ironic name of the show instead of the painful truth.  
So strap yourselves in.  
We got a bumpy new roadmap ahead of us.  

## Kicking the dead horse

I don't know why i started to think that it would be a good idea to try a
serious simulation of physics but i am sure it killed all my fun back then.  
This pile of +#!% also suffered from my good old habit of jumping into a new
thing without ever thinking it through.
